## Enigma Machine Replica Project

Welcome to the Enigma Machine Replica Project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of the historic Enigma machine using modern web technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. The project supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) for a seamless user experience.

## Overview

The Enigma Machine was a cipher device used by the German military during World War II for encryption and decryption of secret messages. This project recreates its functionality in a web application, allowing users to encode and decode messages just like the original machine.

## Features

> Replica Interface: The web application provides an interface that closely mimics the functionality and appearance of the original Enigma machine.
> Encryption and Decryption: Users can input plaintext messages and receive encrypted output, or input encrypted messages and receive decrypted output.
> Configurable Settings: The Enigma machine's rotor configurations, plugboard settings, and initial positions can be customized by the user.
> Real-time Updates: Changes to settings or input are reflected in real-time, providing instant feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used

> Next.js: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) web applications. It provides a powerful foundation for building complex web applications with ease.
> TypeScript: TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, providing improved code quality and developer productivity. It helps catch errors early in the development process and enhances code maintainability.
> Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with pre-defined utility classes. It enables quick styling without the need to write custom CSS, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
> Zustand: Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React applications. It offers a simple and intuitive API for managing global application state, making it easy to share data between components.
